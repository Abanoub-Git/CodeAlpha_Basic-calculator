# üìü Basic Calculator

## Overview

A simple, responsive calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.
Supports basic arithmetic operations and provides a clean, keyboard-friendly interface. Ideal for learning DOM manipulation and event handling.

## ‚ú® Features

* Basic arithmetic: addition (`+`), subtraction (`‚àí`), multiplication (`√ó`), division (`√∑`).
* Clickable buttons and numeric/display screen.
* Real-time expression display and result (updates as user types/clicks).
* Clear (`C`) and all-clear (`AC`) functionality.
* Keyboard support for numbers, operators, Enter (=), Backspace, and Escape.
* Responsive layout that adapts to mobile and desktop.
* Bonus: simple styling improvements and animation for button presses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

* **HTML5** ‚Äî Structure and semantic elements.
* **CSS3** ‚Äî Layout (flex/grid), responsive design, and transitions.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** ‚Äî Input handling, evaluation, keyboard support, and UI updates.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. Use mouse/touch to press buttons or type using your keyboard.

## üß≠ Usage & Controls

* Click number and operator buttons to build an expression.
* Press `=` button or `Enter` key to evaluate.
* `C` ‚Äî clear the current entry (or acts as backspace depending on implementation).
* `AC` ‚Äî clear the entire expression and result.
* `Backspace` ‚Äî removes the last character.
* `Esc` ‚Äî clears the calculator (optional mapping).
* Supports decimal point `.` for floating numbers.

## ‚úÖ Keyboard Mapping (recommended)

* `0‚Äì9` ‚Üí digits
* `.` ‚Üí decimal point
* `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` ‚Üí arithmetic operators (`*` for √ó and `/` for √∑)
* `Enter` or `=` ‚Üí evaluate
* `Backspace` ‚Üí delete last character
* `Escape` ‚Üí clear all

> Tip: When showing operators on UI, display √ó and √∑; map them to `*` and `/` in the JavaScript input parser.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Accuracy

* Avoid using `eval()` on untrusted input. If you use `eval` for simplicity, sanitize or validate the expression first (allow only digits, decimal point, parentheses, and operator characters).
* Better approach: parse and evaluate expressions or use a safe expression evaluator.

## ‚ôø Accessibility

* Ensure buttons are focusable (`<button>`), include `aria-label` attributes for screen readers, and support keyboard navigation (tab order).
* Provide sufficient contrast and visible focus styles.
